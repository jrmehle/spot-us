Welcome to CSJ Northfield and thanks for joining our effort to produce
community funded investigative journalism.

In the meantime, here are some ideas on how to get started:

1. Start a pitch:  Traditionally you would pitch editors, because they
were the only people that had a freelance budget.  At CSJ Northfield community
members band together to build a budget of their own.  Now you can pitch
the public to do the journalism you want! Here is some advice on how to
build good pitches:

2. Find a tip:  Community members let freelance reporters know what is
important to them through story tips. You can search these (and how much
money is potentially on the table) on the browse function here:

We are very hands on and passionate about making sure that the
information needs of our communities are met.  We work for you!!!!
