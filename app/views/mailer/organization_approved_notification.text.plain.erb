Welcome to CSJ Northfield and thanks for joining our effort to produce
community supported journalism.

We apologize for the slight delay in approving your account. News
Organizations are the ONLY type of account that we grant special
privileges to and as a result we are very careful about who is given a
"news organization" account on CSJ Northfield

If you have any questions - don't hesitate to contact David Cohn:

In the meantime - here are some ideas on how to get started.

1. Start a tip: This lets other freelance reporters know what you want
covered.

2. Fund a pitch: Perhaps a freelance reporter has already created a
pitch that would be of interest to you. Your donation could turn it into
a reality. Check out our browse feature here: http://csjnorthfield.org/news_items

As a news organization you are NOT limited in how much you can donate
towards a pitch. This is because you have been vetted to follow the code
of journalistic ethics as described by the Society of Professional
Journalists.

If you donate 50% or more towards a pitch, CSJ Northfield will grant you
temporary exclusive rights to the content.

Or: You can donate 100% towards a pitch and CSJ Northfield will grant you
temporary exclusive rights to the content and reimburse any community
members that had pre-funded the pitch. This is a way to build a new
relationship with your readers. Trust us, they'll love you for refunding
their donation.

We are very hands on and passionate about making sure that the
information needs of our communities are met. We work for you!!!!

Sincerely,
David Cohn
CSJ Northfield
